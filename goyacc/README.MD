This is a temporary staging folder to resolve golang bug, related to GOMODULE and go.sum checksum error.

Users in China seem to be unable to reliably build repo because of URL redirection and blocking of HTTPS endpoints.

Copying the external dependencies into folder in repo should enable offline builds and avoid the go sum checksum error bug.

YACC is staged for deprecation. And is on schedule for deprecation and deletion.
